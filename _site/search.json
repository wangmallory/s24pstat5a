    "text": "What Is Programming?\nComputers, though incredibly useful, are fairly complex machines. To communicate with them, we need to use a specific language, known as a Programming Language. There are a number of programming languages in existence- the language we will use in this particular class is called Python.\n\nNow, running a programming language can be a bit tricky. To aid in this, we often make use of an interface to help us effectively write code that our computers understand. For this particular course, we will use JupyterHub (commonly referred to simply as Jupyter, pronounced “Jupiter” [like the planet]). A document created in Jupyter is called a notebook, and each notebook is comprised of a series of cells."

    "text": "Getting Started\n\nNavigate to https://pstat5a.lsit.ucsb.edu\nClick the “Sign in with your UCSB NetID” button, and sign in.\nUnder “Notebook”, click “Python 3 (ipykernel)” (see below).\n\n\nCongratulations- you have just made your first Jupyter notebook! Now, it’s time for our first task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\n\n\n\nChange the name of your notebook to “Lab01” using the following steps:\n\nIn the lefthand menu bar, find the notebook you just created (by default this will be something like “Untitled” or “Untitled1”), and right-click and click “Rename” (see picture below)\n\n\n\nRename your file to “Lab01”, and then hit the return (enter) key on your keyboard. You should see the filename in the menubar update:\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyterHub Environment\nLet’s take a minute to familiarize ourselves with the JupyterHub environment. Every Jupyter notebook is comprised of what are known as cells; these are the shaded grey rectangles that appear in a Jupyter notebook.\n\nIf your cell has a grey background (like in the image above), it is inactive. To activate a cell, place your cursor inside it, and click:\n\nmeans it is selected and active, and ready to be populated with text and/or code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen you run code using the “Run” button at the top of your environment, only the active cell will be executed.\n\n\n\n\nCells\nThere are two main types of cells we will be using in this class: Markdown cells (which include text/descriptions, but no code) and code cells (which contain code that needs to be run).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, click into the code cell that was automatically created when you created your document to activate it.\nClick on the dropdown menu that currently says “code” (near the center of the top of your interface), and select “Markdown”\n\n\n\nClick back into the cell, copy-paste the text [including the hashtag!] # Task 2, and then run the cell.\nNote that after running your cell from step 3 above, Jupyter automatically created a new code cell. Click into this code cell and run the code 2 + 2.\n\nWhen you are done, your notebook should look something like this:\n\n\n\nNotice that after running a cell, Jupyter automatically adds a new cell right after it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo run a cell and automatically create a new cell underneath it, use the keyboard shortcut SHIFT + ENTER.\n\n\nBy the way, do you notice the little In [1]: at the left of our first cell? This is Jupyter’s syntax for letting us know the order in which Jupyter is executing the code cells. The 1 in our cell from Task 2 above corresponds to the fact that this was the 1st code cell we executed in our document."

    "section": "Coding with Python",
    "text": "Coding with Python\nAs was mentioned previously, Jupyter is only the interface we are using. The actual coding and computations will be done by the programming language Python.\n\nThere is a reason we use the word “language” to describe programming languages- that is because they function quite like a human language. This means that they have their own set of synatxes, rules, and grammars. It is precisely these syntaxes, rules, and grammars we will be learning over the course of these Computing Labs!\n\nPrograms are made up of expressions, like 2 + 2. We evaluate expressions by running (or executing) them in a programming language. Expressions are like the sentences of programming- they contain complex pieces of information that are conveyed between the user and the computer.\n\nMuch like sentences in other languages, expressions must obey a rigid syntax. For example, when we want to perform addition in Python we must use the + symbol; we can’t, for example, say 2 plus 2.\n\nWhat happens when we violate a syntax rule? Well…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mardown cell and write # Task 3\nCreate a code cell, and run 2 plus 2. (You should get an error!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor this class, we expect you to precede each code cell from a particular task with a markdown cell that says # Task X (where X is the number of the task).\n\nWe will stop explicitly writing this step in the tasks below, but you are still expected to include a labeling cell!\n\n\nWell, what is this error saying? Let’s examine it more closely.\n\n  File \"<ipython-input-2-5196071441ec>\", line 1\n    2 plus 2\n      ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nIndeed, Python is telling us exactly what went wrong- the SyntaxError part of the error message tells us that we violated one of the syntax rules of Python, and the ^ pointing to the p in plus is telling us that the exact syntax error occurred when we tried to use the word plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways read error messages!\n\n\nThe messages that Python displays when we get an error are Python’s way of trying to communicate with us what is going wrong!"

As a rule-of-thumb, Python adheres to the order of operations:\n\nParentheses\nExponents\nMultiplication\nDivision\nAddition\nSubtraction\n\nHere is a list of mathematical operators and their corresponding Python syntax:\n\n\n\nOperation\nPython Operator\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nAddition\n+\n2 + 2\n4\n\n\nSubtraction\n-\n2 - 2\n0\n\n\nMultiplication\n*\n2 * 2\n4\n\n\nDivision\n/\n2 / 2\n1\n\n\nExponentiation\n**\n2 ** 2\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4\n\n\n\nCompute the following:\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2 + 3}{4 + 5^6}\\)\n\\(\\displaystyle (1 - 3 \\cdot 4^5)^{\\frac{6}{7}}\\)\n\n\n\nNaturally, Python is capable of much more than just basic arithmetic!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5\n\n\n\nCreate a code chunk and run sin(1) to compute the sine of 1.\n\n\nUh-oh- looks like we’ve encountered another error! Indeed, even the most experience coder will often run up against errors like this, and need to subsequently enter the stage of debugging their code.\n\nWe’re now getting a new error: this time, it’s a NameError. As the name suggests, this is Python’s way of telling us that it doesn’t recognize the name of something we’ve written. In fact, it’s explicitly saying:\n\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined,\n\nThis is Python’s way of telling us that it (somehow) doesn’t know what sin means.\n\nTo answer the question of why this is, we need to take a bit of a detour into the world of packages."

Programming languages often compartmentalize information into what are known as modules (sometimes called packages in the context of other programming languages). Python modules are files containing additional functions that aren’t immediately accessible to us when we first launch Python. To gain access to the information stored in a particular module, import it.\n\nThe syntax for loading an entire module is:\n\nfrom <package name> import *\n\nSometimes, we may not want to import the entirety of a module and instead import only a couple of functions from that module. In that case, we would use the syntax: The syntax for loading specific functions from a Python package is\n\nfrom <package name> import <function name>\n\nWe’ll talk a lot more about packages in a future lab. For now, let’s return to our task of computing \\(\\sin(1)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5 (cont’d)\n\n\n\nIt turns out that the sin() function is located in the math module Load all functions from the math module, and then try re-running sin(1)."

    "section": "Variable Assignment",
    "text": "Variable Assignment\nLet’s talk a bit about variables. Just like in math, variables in a programming language refer to a placeholder name for a particular piece of information (be it a function, value, etc.) The act of storing information in a variable is called assignment, and in Python variable assignment is performed using the = symbol.\n\n<variable name> = <what you want to associate with the variable>\n\nFor example, after running\n\nx = 2\n\nthe quantity x will always be synonymous with the quantity 2, and running x + 2 will return a value of 4 (as 2 + 2 = 4).\n\nPython affords a lot of flexibility when it comes to variable names- that is, we can pick almost anything we want to be a variable name! There are, however, some exceptions:\n\nVariable names cannot start with a number\nVariable names cannot include a space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is a good programming practice to give your variables names that are descriptive, but not overly long.\n\n\nSometimes it will be necessary to update or re-assign a new value to an existing variable. For example, let’s examine the structure of the following code:\n\nx = 2\nx = x + 3\n\nWhat do you think calling x will return? If you said 5, you’d be correct! The key point of this is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn variable assignment, Python starts by executing the righthand side of the equality before executing the lefthand side.\n\n\nSo, in code example above, Python first executed x + 3 (which is equivalent to 2 + 3; i.e. 5), and then re-assigned x the value 5."

    "section": "Data Types",
    "text": "Data Types\nThe final topic of this week’s lab is that of data types and variable assignment.\n\nThe term data type loosely refers to the actual type of a particular quantity (e.g. numerical, character, etc.) The main data types we will encounter in this class are:\n\nfloat: refers to numerical (real-valued) data\nint: short for integer; refers to numerical data that are integers\nstr: short for string; refers to character- or text-type data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 7\n\n\n\nRun each of the following:\n\ntype(1)\ntype(1.1)\ntype(\"hello\")\n\n\n\nLet’s combine our knowledge of variable assignment with our newfound knowledge of data types!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 8\n\n\n\n(a) Perform the following variable assignments:\n\ncourse = \"PSTAT 5A\"\nnum_sections = 4\nsection_capacity = 25\n\n(c) A new section has been added! Update the variable num_sections to be one more than when you initially defined it above. (Don’t just use num_sections = 5- think about our discussion on updating variables above!)\n(b) Using comments, write down what you think the output of each of the following expressions will be:\n\ntype(course)\ntype(num_sections)\nnum_sections * section_capacity\n\nThen, run each expression in a separate code chunk and comment on the results.\n(c) Create a new variable called course_capacity and assign it the value of the maximum capacity of the course. (Hint: there are only 5 sections, and each section has a maximum capacity of 25. Try to use your already-defined variables as much as possible!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe type() function can be used to identify the data type of a particular quantity.\n\n\n\nIncrementing Variables\nIt turns out that Python has a very succinct notation for incrementing variables. Suppose we have a random variable x that is assigned the value 3, and suppose we want to update x to be 2 more than its previous value. As was mentioned in the previous section of this lab, we could use the following code:\n\nx = 3\nx = x + 2\n\nWe can shorten our second line above using the += symbol:\n\nx = 3\nx += 2\n\nSimilarly, if we wanted to multiply the value of x by some number (say, 4) and assign the resulting value back to x, we could use the *= symbol:\n\nx *= 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 9\n\n\n\nConsider the following code:\n\nx = 2\ny = x + 3\nz = y / 2\n\nx += 2\ny *= 4\nz -= 3\n\n(a) Using a comment, write down what you think the values of x, y, and z will be after running the above code.\n(b) Now, copy-paste the code into a code cell, run it, and see what values x, y, and z take after running the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe syntax x += y is equivalent to x = x + y, and adds the value y to the currently-assigned value of x and then assigns the new value to the variable x."

As such, we cannot simply take the classification of variables and apply that to the entire dataset (unless our dataset consists of only one variable).\nThis may seem like a subtle point… and it is!
